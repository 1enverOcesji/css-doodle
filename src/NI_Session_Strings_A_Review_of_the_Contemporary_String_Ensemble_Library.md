NI Session Strings offers a variety of sound presets, articulations and play assistance features that make it easy to create realistic and expressive string arrangements. You can control the dynamics, expression and tone of the ensemble with 14 articulations, ranging from accent, pizzicato and crescendo to legato and portamento. You can also use the smart voice split feature to automatically allocate notes to the correct instrument group, or the smart chord feature to generate fully orchestrated ensemble chords from single keys.
 
One of the most innovative features of NI Session Strings is the rhythm animator, which allows you to add motion and groove to your chords with an arpeggiator that has assignable articulations, chord and note options per step. You can also transform the sound of your ensemble with a turn of one knob using the color feature, which applies a powerful master multi-effect to the whole group.
 
NI Session Strings is compatible with the free Kontakt Player or Kontakt 5, and it requires 11 GB of disk space. It is available for $99 from Native Instruments website[^1^], or as part of Komplete 13 bundle. If you want a larger string ensemble with more playing and mixing flexibility, you can also check out NI Session Strings Pro 2[^3^], which doubles the ensemble size and offers more customization options.
 
NI Session Strings is a great choice for anyone who wants to add some contemporary string flavor to their tracks, without spending hours of fine tuning and tweaking. It is easy to use, sounds great and offers a lot of creative possibilities. Whether you need some warm and punchy strings for your pop song, some funky and soulful licks for your R&B track, or some atmospheric and cinematic pads for your score, NI Session Strings can deliver.
  
NI Session Strings also comes with a sleek and intuitive interface that gives you access to various performance and production features. For instance, you can engage true legato or portamento for smooth transitions between notes, or use the smart chord feature to play complex chords with one finger. You can also adjust the stereo width, bow noise, attack and release times, and apply convolution reverb and delay effects to your strings.
 
One of the most impressive features of NI Session Strings is the animator, which is a powerful arpeggiator that can create rhythmic phrases with different articulations, chords and notes per step. You can choose from 48 preset patterns or create your own custom ones, and sync them to your host tempo. The animator can add instant groove and movement to your chords, and it works well for pop, dance and cinematic genres.
 
NI Session Strings is not a comprehensive orchestral library, nor does it aim to be. It is a focused and specialized library that delivers a high-quality and versatile string ensemble sound for contemporary music production. It is easy to use, sounds great and offers a lot of creative possibilities. Whether you need some warm and punchy strings for your pop song, some funky and soulful licks for your R&B track, or some atmospheric and cinematic pads for your score, NI Session Strings can deliver.
